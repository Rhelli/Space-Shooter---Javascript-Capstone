## üî∞ The Project Brief

This is the Javascript Capstone Project, to be completed by students of [Microverse](https://www.microverse.org/).

With 5 days to complete the Javascript Capstone project, there's a lot of work to be done - but that's the point. The Javascript Capstone, much like those before it, are meant to test us in more realistic, industry-like situations. We're given a project to tackle, which often includes a new piece of tech and given a tight deadline to adhere to.

For this particular Capstone project, I was tasked with creating a 'shooting' game in 5 days, using Phaser - a new technology to me at the beginning of the 5 days. Additional requirements were to build in functionality for a scoreboard and storing via a provided Service API, as well as include tests for all functions not encased in Phaser classes.

## üõ†Ô∏è The Nitty Gritty
The Capstone project was broken down into 5 particular days of events:

### Day 1 - Learning About the Phaser Javascript Library
This step included getting to grips with the potential that Phaser held. Additionally, ensuring that Phaser was set up correctly with Webpack was a crucial first step - if they wern't playing nice from the get-go, no progress was going to be made anytime soon.

### Day 2 - Game Design and Assembling Assets
The design direction I chose was a typical, retro feeling game. The tutorial that was initially provided created the basis for the game that I finalised in the end, however there were multiple changes, tweaks and additions I made to make a game that was more engaging than that suggested in the tutorial. Namely, I wanted to include:
  - A parallax effect for the background
  - Multiple enemies
  - A progression in the difficulty as the player's score increased
  - Messages for the player
  - Some semblance of a story for the player to follow

The result of wanting to make the game more dynamic than suggested by the tutorial was a greatly increased need for assets. As a result, a lot of searching was done on [OpenGameArt](https://opengameart.org/), which is a fantastic source for anyone looking for assets for non-commercialised games.

### Day 3 - Game Setup (Basic scene creation, player movement, game boot, etc)
Following a previous tutorial and mixing it with other tutorials, this stage included creating the numerous scenes that would be completed at a later stage. Namely;
  - The 'Boot Scene', which starts the game;
  - The 'Preloader Scene', which is responsible for pre-loading all game assets so they do not need to be loaded at each scene start;
  - The 'Player Name' scene, where the user enters their user name (or pilot name) for use in the highscore screens;
  - The 'Title Scene', otherwise known as the 'Main Menu' to the player;
  - The 'Story Scene', where a basic story is relayed to the user for a bit of fun;
  - The 'Game Scene', where all the action is at;
  - The 'Game Over' scene, where all the action ain't;
  - The 'Post Game Highscore Scene', where the users recently attained score is uploaded to online storage via the provided service API. Previous scores are also shown.
  - The regular 'Highscore Scene', accessible from the Main menu, this is where the user goes to see the current leaderboard of scores.
  - The 'Options Scene', where game options can be managed, and;
  - The 'Credits Scene'

In addition to the creation of these scenes, enabling player movement in the 'Game Scene' was of paramount importance in order to begin creating some interactivity.

### Day 4 - Enemy Creation and Spawning Enemies
Once the basics of the scenes had been set up and player movement had been introduced, enemies were defined, created and a spawning system was created. However, as this game includes 5 different enemies, this in turn meant creating:
  - 5 different spawning systems - We don't want all the enemies to spawn at the same time or simply staggered... Thats boring!
  - 5 different classes for the enemies - They have to act differently too!
  - 5 different classes for the enemies weapons - Again, these can't all be the same!

### Day 5 - Score System implementation & Finalisation with additional features
This stage entailed piecing together the different enemies and the player's interaction. In reality, the scoring system is fairly basic:
  - Gunships (i.e. the Pink and Green ships) are worth 1 point each;
  - Chaser Ships (i.e. the Blue ones which follow you if you get too close) are worth 2 points each;
  - The Carrier Ships (i.e. the Yellow one) are worth 4 points each.

Additionally, we were required to connect our in game scores with a service API in order to make the storage of our scores a tad more persistent. It was also at this stage that I decided to include a few features which I thought would benefit the final outcome of the game. Namely:
  - Difficulty progression: The more ships you destroy, the greater the decrease in time between the spawn of a new ship;
  - Filling out the Story Scene
  - Adding messages for the player depending on the number of ships they have downed

#### Setup
Setup should be fairly straightforward. You will have to ensure your machine is properly equipped to run the code first:
  1. Make sure you have both [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/) and Ruby on Rails ([Mac](https://gorails.com/setup/osx/10.15-catalina) ‚Ä¢ [Linux](https://gorails.com/setup/ubuntu/19.10) ‚Ä¢ [Windows](https://gorails.com/setup/windows/10)) installed.
  2. Download this repository.
  3. **`cd`** into the root directory of wherever you download this repo. [What does 'cd' mean?](https://www.macworld.com/article/2042378/master-the-command-line-navigating-files-and-folders.html)
  4. Whilst at the root (home) directory of this project, enter **`bundle install`** to install the projects software dependencies.
  5. In your terminal window, enter **`rails server`** to start the server.
  6. Now navigate to **`localhost:3000`** in your browser to start playing around with the webpages!

Alternatively if you'd like to confirm the entire project is passing testing:
  1. **`cd`** into this repository in your terminal
  2. Enter **`bundle exec rspec`** to run all tests
